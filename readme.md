Enter all the data you remember about this specific song and you'll get 10 songs that are the most likely to be your guess. Based on LLM, substring searching, logistic regression and data filtering. This project contains a database of all 245 Red Hot Chili Peppers songs with all the important information, such as the album, release year, lyrics and sometimes additional stuff, like if it's instrumental or has music video.
