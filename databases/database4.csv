True Men Don't Kill Coyotes;The Red Hot Chili Peppers;1984;;"Hoo, lord!
I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
The farther west – the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt and I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Riding wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood hills
I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
Just don't tell me anything
'Cause that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt and I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Riding wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood hills
Passion drippin' from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
And blood never lies, pale face die
True men don't kill coyotes

Baby Appeal;The Red Hot Chili Peppers;1984;;"On the city streets, I got the tunes in my box
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
Out of my way, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to think and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin', that itty bitty tot
Her pop said no, but she just couldn't stop
The kid had a case of toddler rock
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, it makes them squeal
The Chili Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we reel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots the funk-o-meal
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We stoke the fire, we crank the heat
Four groove dog brothers funkin' out in the streets
Rockin' up a storm when who do we meet
But the hop, skip, jump up bumpin' baby de beat
She was a shaking and a kicking those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she called out her fleet
Five thousand babies rocking out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight I mean and golly gee whizz!
I just can't tell you how much we dig
Rocking right out for those itty bitty kids, rock out
Well here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, it makes them squeal
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we reel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk-o-meal
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!
Got the tunes in my box
Baby appeal
Rock out!
Play the chili, play the chili, play the chili

Why Don't You Love Me;The Red Hot Chili Peppers;1984;;"Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Oh, why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebody changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'
In a long, long while
We don't get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Green Heaven;The Red Hot Chili Peppers;1984;;"About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend, foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think a different way, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?
Time now take you to a different place
Where peace-loving whales flow through liquid outer space
A grooving and a gliding as graceful as lace
A never-losing touch with ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at 'em with a gun
They have a lot of love for every livin' creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm going to meet ya
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
A trigger-happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the American tradition
Along with goin' fishin', apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

Mommy Where's Daddy;The Red Hot Chili Peppers;1984;;"Mommy, where's daddy?
Mommy, where's daddy?
Right here, girl
Oh, sweet thing, you look so sad
Cheer up, don't you know your dad is bad?
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad
There ain't one problem I can't fix, 'cause
Your daddy's got a big old bag-o-trix
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad
Mommy, where's daddy?
Mommy, where's daddy?
Come on, sit on your daddy's lap 'cause
I'm the one who pats yo back

Well, lemme start by tuckin' you in
Give daddy a kiss, girl

Out In L.A.;The Red Hot Chili Peppers;1984;;"We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA
LA is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton-picking maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps, but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Alike dump on a thumb
Pop hump, hump, hump, pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
Because I'm shooting for the top, and my best friend's a Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls could pop
But he never met the tree, so he never bebopped, hop out
Antoine the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
Wore a cold paisley jacket and a hella fine ass
In between his legs was a sweet young lass
Threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love them all
By the time he got to ninety-nine, he had to stop
'Cause that's when he thought that he heard a fop
Last night and the night before
I heard a fop outside, then I
Came indoors! Rock out!
Now that I told ya somethin' about the Flea
Somethin' 'bout the Tree
A little somethin' 'bout me
I can't leave you hanging 'bout my man Sherm Zee
He swings the yin, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his thang
You better be burnin' Sherman!
We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA
Step out!

What It Is (Nina's Song);The Red Hot Chili Peppers;1984;Bonus Track;"Give it up to this time full of strife
Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life
Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight
At the never-ending ocean of perfect insights
Around your molecule beam with a halo of light
The animated aura will give delight
Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight
With the power of it, we are about to astound
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound
""Listen very close,"" my inner voice expounds
""We are the human race, and we groove to the sound""
Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth
A soul-shocking sound with electrify the earth
People have to know that it's not about money
Cash is not the way to make your life sunny
There is no need if you got the soul seed
Love, life, and peace, it can only begin
When you know in your heart that the change is within
Love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the missus and love all the misses
And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses
Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong
Balance your life with the right kind of foods
To eat a sad cow, is to eat another you
Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude
It'll put your karma in the worst of moods
Someone drinkin' booze and taking too many ludes
'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude
And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you
So please, y'all, take some sound advice
Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice
The always sober you is especially nice
Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot
I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute
Refuse to fight wars for political whores
Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores
It is my notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean
Long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion
There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
We will learn much peace with the whale as your teacher
""Good morning class, how very nice to meet you.""
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong
Open up your hearts to the planets, to the stars
With your spirit take, a trip from Venus to Mars
You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid
Now Albert lives forever in every single kid
But, with Adolf Hitler, we are permanently rid
Picasso, Mister Dali, and my man, Jimi Hendrix
These cool brothers make the world go 'round
Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimi did it with sound
But, by all these men, it was found
Each and every person can be just as renowned
Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown
Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down
Go spread the word from town to town
We are the human race and we groove to the sounds
(Red hot
Red hot, red hot, red hot, red hot)
Now that you've heard what it is in a song
From here on in, you can do no wrong

Jungle Man;Freaky Styley;1985;;"Deep inside the soul hole of a-Mother Earth
Father Time came with a supersonic, supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle givin' bush, baby, bush-baby birth
The baby was a boy, but I think what stunned her
Is that this bare-breasted baby was a baby boy, boy, boy, boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone came thelonious thunder, yeah
Fill the sky with hellfire from way down, down, down under

His jungle turned to concrete, his funk bone, bone, bone, bone to stone
Like a full-blown volcano, I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein, atomic lava blood flows, and flows
His soul-shocking sounds, they make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man, it's time to
Take, take, take, take the throne
I'm a jungle man

Though these words dig deep, they offer no relief
God save the queen, I am an Indian chief

There is a memory, uh huh, that lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid on all you touched
But the burning flame, it turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide and that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane, I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died when it should have been saved

Sex Rap;Freaky Styley;1985;;"Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're going to get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumping that driving bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Sucking on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
Make her moan, make her groan and make her shout
Push it all in and pull it all out
Pump that labia 'till it pouts
Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the booty bustin' beat pound your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
As you're droppin' to your knees and I come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down
Our lustful notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady loving a viable stud
Causing what is known as a juicy wet pud
Getting it getting it getting' it good
In my head, as a jellified hum
I take to rubbing her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb I strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like oozing hot cum

Yertle The Turtle;Freaky Styley;1985;;"Look at that turtle go, bro
On a far away island of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle was king of the pond
A nice little pond, it was clean it was neat
The water was warm, there was plenty to eat
Until one day the king of them all
Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough and that's the trouble with me
With this stone for a throne, I am too low down
I cannot look down upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king gave a command
He ordered all the turtles onto one another's back
He piled them high into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle, the things I now rule
I'm king of a cow, I'm king of a mule
Look at that turtle go, bro
Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burping' little turtle
Looked up and said ""I beg
Your pardon king Yertle""
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
""Silence!"" the king of the turtles barked back
To the bad burping little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle, oh marvelous me
For I am ruler of all that I see
Yertle, Yertle the turtle

I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay
Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires, but we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, and everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, there's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide, we've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives
We're millionaires
Against hunger
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare
I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay
Well I'm a millionaire too
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use
I want anything that I can have, but I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far, but I'll be okay, cuz I won't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, you know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires, every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn
We're millionaires

Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire

Fight Like A Brave;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan;1987;;"All you slingers and fiends
Hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard
I'm not here to box
This is no showdown
So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from Park Ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talkin' 'bout that freedom
Fight like a brave
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Or get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Or get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission
Fight like a brave – don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave – don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
I am here today to talk about the Uplift Mofo Party Plan
A plan based on a band, a band based on a plan
There shall be no slaves in the land of lands, it's a Hollywood jam
You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
'Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me, that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme
Fight like a brave (Fight like a brave) don't be a slave (Another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (Fight like a brave) don't be a slave (Another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (Fight like a brave) don't be a slave (Another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (Fight like a brave) don't be a slave (Another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

A grain of sand
My love for life is fuelled by
The love for my band
I love his mother and
The silly mixed-up man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love is the Zulu groove
My love is coop-a-loop move
My love is lightning's blues
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is gettin' skin on my flute
My love, my love
My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a bunch of knuckleheads
My love for the sweet smell of bread
My love for the legs that I spread
My love for the fat natty dread
My love, my love
My love is my toes in the sand
My love is my dick in my hand
My love is my dope in the van
My love is my dick in your pants

Organic anti-beat box band
There's a party in my town at 12:00
There's a party that's rocking down to the rock
I've got nothing against hip hop
But there's a party in my town and
No beat box jam that is
The party's got girls the girls got hot
The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped, the doors unlocked
The house got up ran around the block
Sit down house
Take off your blouse
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
Very good friend of the lollipop kids
Over the rainbow with the wiz
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
With the organic anti-beat box band

Good Time Boys;Mother's Milk;1989;;"Indeed, it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel 'round the world, getting naked on the stage
Busting people out of their everyday cage
We like to think we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mami and our papi
Funky young kings, we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talking about my buddies, funk it up Fishbone!
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open, it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day the good time boys might just be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's going to shatter every stone cold face
Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Making more than money, more than money can buy
I stop and take a listen to the Monsters try
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't believe me, you can ask John Doe
'Cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you about the band called Firehose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
B-b-building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty Watts Towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a badass fact
A claim that remains intact
M-A-G-I-C, see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C, Magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams
But he don't give a fuck
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes Magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck
Scott stops, pops, and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named AC Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is comin' to your town and he's gonna make rubble

You can swim, but you won't get far
So you might as well go home
M-A-G-I-C in Buck we trust
Restoring order to the court, and justice is a must
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
'Cause they've got more moves than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum that deafens my ears
The one and only known of his kind sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for bein' bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar, all-time great super, superstar
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is comin' to your town and he's gonna make rubble
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)

I proceeded to plead. Will fathers help me decide?
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple-black sky
The red cloud rains, and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds, and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I'm a master of a destin' and I got to take action

She washes me until I'm clean, then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow, then we make it very fast

Castles Made Of Sand;Mother's Milk;1989;Bonus Track;"Down the street, you can hear her scream, ""You're a disgrace!""
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now, he stands outside
All the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries, ""Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""
Against the door, he leans, and starts a scene
But his tears fall, burn, and gard-all green
And some castle made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually
An Indian brave, who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream, that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more, the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song
Fight his first battle
But somethin' went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
And some castle made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually
Take it, Johnny
There was a young girl who was heart with a frown
She was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop livin'
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, ""You won't hurt me no more.""
But then, a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
""Look a golden-winged ship is passin' my way.""
But it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on goin'
And some castles made of sand
Slips into the sea, eventually

The Power Of Equality;Blood Sugar Sex Magik;1991;;"I've got a soul that can not sleep
At night when something just ain't right
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red, black, or white, this is my fight
Come on courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?
Power of the equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality
Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
A-media chief, you menace me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear?
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?
Power of the equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality
I've got tapes, I've got CDs
I've got my Public Enemy
My lily white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?
Power of the equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality
Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, 'cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little Piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
A-dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No, I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot
Little brother, do you hear me?
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity?
Whatever happened to humanity?

Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho
""Sir Psycho Sexy, that is me!
Sometimes I find I need to scream""
He's a freak of nature, but we love him so
He's a freak of nature, but we let him go
Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no, that would be treason
Believe me, Eve, she gave good reason
Booty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' 'cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever

I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile
She said get out and spread your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said ""What's up? Now suck my dick""
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch, so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped, ""Ooh, that's tight""
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip

All the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries, ""Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""
Against the door, he leans, and starts a scene
But his tears fall, burn, and gard-all green
And some castle made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually
An Indian brave, who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream, that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more, the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song
Fight his first battle
But somethin' went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
And some castle made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually
Take it, Johnny
There was a young girl who was heart with a frown
She was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop livin'
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, ""You won't hurt me no more.""
But then, a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
""Look a golden-winged ship is passin' my way.""
But it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on goin'
And some castles made of sand
Slips into the sea, eventually

Deep Kick;One Hot Minute;1995;;"It started when we were little kids
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents
We got together and wrote on desks
And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
And slipped through whatever cracks we could find
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away from it
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spirals
Leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind
Still, the brothers, blood comrades, partner, family, cousin was impenetrable
And we lived inside it
Laughing with no clothes, and everything experimental until death was upon us
In our face, mortality
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us
And did, while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and volatile around us
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same
So we keep moving
We keep moving
(Ooh shit! Ooh shit!)
Went off and got some hair cuts
Looking wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a BART bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
The motherfuckers woke us up
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs
Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no, no
Two young brothers on a hovercraft (yeah)
Telepathic love and belly laughs (oh yeah)

We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealing anything that we could
Got to sneak into the Starwood
Got to peak into the deep good
I remember
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the Butt-hole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
Yea, we were young
And we were looking
Looking
Looking for that deep kick
Yeah, (I've) seen them come, seen them go

I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirty world
Go down on you
Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceived by fear
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
Let's get soft and
Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red
Let's make peace and
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceived by fear
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love
Some sing dirty
Some sang clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceived by fear
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame

Stretch You Out;One Hot Minute;1995;Bonus Track;"Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favor of this motion

Give something to my brother
Proposing to expose your head
To something that is like no other
Hit it

Receive it and believe it
And it's braiding and creating love
Tender titillation

I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

There's a glowing offer up around the moon
It's showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing
Very legendary
Extra planetary fairy
Very true, she's making just for you

Give something to the stranger
M-m-m-moving to improve the groove
A mental transformation

I'll stretch you out again

Darker than the darkest night
Living hell and pollocks at you
Getting new down your back
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

Quixoticelixer;Californication;1999;Bonus Track;"Kick back a little just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it were so when you told me
That you were solid gold
Gravity-free is she, look at her
Highness on a mattress full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
Your Smell or your go to hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it probably will not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how
Did I get your lipstick on my kite
I love this weather
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
It's a perfect storm
Just keep it coming
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
In its perfect form
I love this weather
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Cause it keeps me warm
Just keep it coming
(Come back)
In its perfect form
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Oh lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind in a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terrible is a soul
When she told me that there is such a thing
Do you know that you glow when you go
From winter in to spring
I love this weather
It's the perfect storm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form
I love this weather
Cause it keeps me warm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form
The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick gets strong
Mad boy, sad song
A wicked fate, but the sick gets strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on fourth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick gets
Kick back a little just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
I stand before you there's no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you

Over Funk;Californication;1999;Bonus Track;"Please start dirty
It's 7:30
Loss of mind and
Cat alertly
My best, your rest
Send your call
And then I nest
Perversity in features
Adversity that teaches
Some call love more
Soon I'll call the rhythm song
It's over
It's over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It's over
It's over now
I dare not get a look
Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call
Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum
Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favor
This kiss from a mess
Send my girl riddle less
It's over
It's over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It's over
It's over now
I dare not get a look
See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
There's an only count
This stands for all of them
Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong
It's over
It's over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It's over
It's over now
I dare not get a look

She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because I acted like a bodyguard
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My God, that I have ever seen
Tearing up my serotonin
Messing with my dopamine
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
Just about the time
That I was feeling smart again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She knew what she was doing
When she told me no she would
Never let the perfect message
In and get the perfect screwing
Oh Yohanna love, oh, oh

Where time gets fast but everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline? Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid
This is my calling, I said, my darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said, my darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene? Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it but I've got to know
This is my calling, I said, my darling

I saw you out there yesterday, what did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray, what did you wanna say?
A master piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray
Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean
I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake it but I've gotta know

Hammers are falling, I said, my darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you

Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I knew that it would be with you

Overcome and more will always be revealed

Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm

More will be revealed, my friend

The Zephyr Song;By The Way;2002;;"Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on?
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down, no, not today
Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Picking up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look it's on display, for you
Coming down, no not today
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-whoa, do you
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-whoa, want to
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're going to live forever

Can't Stop;By The Way;2002;;"Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Wait a minute, I'm passin' out
Win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need
Somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin'
Than anything I ever knew
Right on cue
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig

East side love is living on the West End

Don't die, you know, the truth is some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through

I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really want to do is turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I use my senses, too
You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all in then I'd find a way to share
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
Come again and tell me where you want to go
What it means for me to be with you alone
Close the door and no one has to know
How we are
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free
I could die for you, what you wanna do?

Midnight;By The Way;2002;;"Things will never be the same
Still, I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up, but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up, and then I take it off the shelf
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of Scorpio's a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe (Ah-ah)
Say it now, 'cause John and Jane would like to know (Ah-ah)
Is it safe inside your head?
Songs to serenade the dead
All along, I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Into the shadow showing
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the loaded kids

Tell me where you want me

Coming on strong, Baudelaire

Let it rise before you
This is my crime
All in all and I'm loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this
In the end and then all will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
Devil may cry, Devil may care
Distiller's got a scream an' now I know just why when she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage

Venice Queen;By The Way;2002;;"Does it go from east to west, y'all
Body free and a body less, y'all
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in coming through the mesh, y'all
Checking in just to get it blessed, y'all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam
Where you come from, where you're going?
Where you come from, where you're going?
Do it all then it all again, y'all
Make it up and you make a friend, y'all
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend, y'all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, y'all
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
Where you come from, where you're going?
Where you come from, where you're going?
We all want to tell her, tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her, tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever

We used to disagree
Now that it's time for you to leave

Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air

And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of all I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?

The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave

Yell into a telescope
Aim it at the star of hope

Going to set your fish on fire
Pistol whipping of desire

Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever knew me
Happy days, but sad I'm facing
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse
A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Got a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Want to smell your sunny face
Funny place but it's never a waste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention?
Make it up, making you my business
A funny buttercup but I lend her forgiveness

Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye

Will find a way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can't take it for another minute

And where you wanna go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time, oh

Lost in the valley without my horses

God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold
She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

And these are the things that I

Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The love of a Martian
Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'

Losin' what I love today

Though this is not her Lord, in case
The one who can't afford to face
Her image is restored to grace
Disappeared. No trace. Musky tears. Suitcase
The down turn brave little burncub bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages
Down and out but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages. No loft
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its
It's for you
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck muscles and bottle-nosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race. A shehive stare and chase
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket. Your ilk is funny to the turnstile touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternights' fallen freckles... away

Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago, I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere, just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme, you are the rise
And when you hear this, you'll know it's your jam, it's your goodbye

To where we all belong
We all crossed when we were feeling lost it's just the time
Kateri cried the day her lover died she recognized
Because he gave her a life of real love it's no surprise
The nights are long but the years are short when you're alive
Way back when will never be again, it was a time
It's going to catch you so glad I met you to walk the line

Far away
But we both know it's somewhere
I saw you on the back page
Of some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes
Said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers
Not today
Send a message to her
A message that I'm coming
Coming to pursue her
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I've got you ten times over
I'll chase you down 'til you're dead
I saw you on a TV station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Is now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker
Someone ought to situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way
Time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl
So never mind what I do
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soulmate country
And I left it all for your head
I saw you in the church yard
And there was no time to exchange
You were getting married
And it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
Now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get used to
So now I will refuse to
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soulmate country
And I left it all for your head

Simple as your stride
Elementary, the chemistry
Means everything to me

Magpies On Fire;I'm With You Sessions;2013;;"Magpies on fire
Making love like little wolves out on the porch
Can lead to medicine
Oh well, I'm game for anything at all
Scarecrow's a liar
Spins a yarn and no one ever checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon and now it's time to fall
All along it's like a bird
Who's trapped alone inside your cage, love
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
All and all it's just the call
Of something wild beyond your room
There's a changing of the major chord
Your minor threat will do, love
My gun misfired
Shot myself instead
I guess I always knew
I'd be the one to lose
That screen door slams
Time to make a move
Help me
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
All and all it's like a bird
Who's trapped alone inside your cage, love
A bird who's born to live at half your age, girl
A bird who's never really had a say
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
Least of all she's like a bird
Who's now been freed from someone's cage

You are my Victorian machinery
(Breathe yourself to life)
Lady
Your tender shape is bending like the scenery

You be the sail and baby I'll be the rudder

A seminal pleasure, I will love you forever
When I heeded your call and every heavy endeavor
I'll keep your place, whoa!

Never Is A Long Time;I'm With You Sessions;2013;;"If I stall it all, or hesitate
The world would always never seems to wait
A comedy that could be so divine
Never is a long time
A shadow born to steal the light of day
You woke me up and said, ""Come on. Let's play.""
Well now I know this never has its way
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away
The laws that cause it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you, for you, I do
I thought I done it all, I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked as clear as you
Now every never that I knew was fine
But never is a long time
Now I share this feeling with my Dad
Stolen goods aren't always half that bad
A never that will always
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away
The law that caused it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you
The faded piping on your dress
Will always have its place, I guess
By you, by you
A common love that we can bless
The pleasure of my child's mess
Golden books and tenderness
Have rescued me from emptiness
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away
The laws that cause it all to stay
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away

Wondering, what did I miss?
I watched the waves come in
Roll in, roll out
Without a single doubt
Lone on a bluff
Is there ever enough?
I stare into the air
Somewhere out there
The family affair
Bring home the night
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life
She gave me the love
Coming up short
And I'm sad to report
We fuss and fight tonight
Your case, my case
Another day to waste
Lovers don't mix
When they can't even fix
A plot that has a twist
To share, my prayer
I need my baby Bear
Come home tonight, whoa
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Hometown Gypsy;I'm With You Sessions;2013;;"Drivin' up the coast
To find a version of the truth
Left the backdoor swinging
Like a dirty little sleuth
The truth is I have never
Felt half this alive
Now it's time to dance
Upon the grave called 45
Jacked up on some Kerouac
And surely bullet proof
The girl who taught me what to do
Was missing her front tooth
Gentle as a storm
Inside your mental health
I wanna find the answer
But I just can't find myself
I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let's run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown
Later I would look for love
Inside a woman's dorm
A couch to keep me humble
And her breath to keep me warm
Ophelia was the girl
That I was feeling for
Come to realize
It was me who was the whore
A captain lost himself
Inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge
And we always wanted more
Drunken sailors
Seeking their Geronimo
Instead they found the things
That they really didn't wanna know
I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let's run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown
Country roads
Would never let me stay
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
A devil's growl and cat's meow
Were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites
Were eating all the fun
A juggernaut of comedy
And blasphemy
I wanna stop the madness
But I think it has to be
I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let's run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown
Country roads
Would never let me stay

In love dying
One foot in the astral plane
Someone's sighing
There's a virgin road
Waiting to be strode
Rope's untying
This power I could not withhold
Satisfying
What do we contain?
Can't stop crying
These tears of change remain the same
My girl, she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead
In love dying
Does it go two ways?
In love dying
This body I can not detain
Wake up flying
She the solar shores
Passers buying
The memories we readorn
In love dying
Nothing to obtain
In love dying
No crawling through the halls of fame
My girl, she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead

Loss becomes the gain
In love dying
Recreate me so I may sustain

Want me dead

So full of lead

Catch My Death;I'm With You Sessions;2013;;"Death
Let me catch my breath
Let me see what's left
Let me see what's true
Do I really want to
Run from my depths?
Will I have regrets?
Will I ever find you?
Will I ever find the words
That give me motive to express?
Bread
Will I go unfed?
Will I be that fool who rushes on in
To where angels fear to tread?
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
When you're leaning on love
Those grateful dead
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending numbers
Chess
Let me play my best
When I do regress
Let it all unwind
'Cause we're never confined
To the board unless
There's a second guess
Look into the sky
Where we all comply
With something higher than the
Rest my love, sail through

To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must
Someone like you
Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I'm a child
Stayed for a while
Flesh
Is it meaningless?
But we all protest
To the last request
Is there anything you
Could now suggest?
Did I do my best?
Did I leave it better?
Even though we look to be
Just mildly obsessed with you
Sail through
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

So I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Datsun painted green, and
Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter. The rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights
And, well, you know, we'd smoke weed and we'd go up in the hills, and we'd listen to progressive rock music, and just kind of trip out and... Well, we would dream, you know. We would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music. And, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star, and I didn't even know what that was. I was like, ""Whatever you want to do, man, I'm coming with you, I'm right with you my friend.""

Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read for the simple man like me? I don't think so
I reach out to my family and I say, ""It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky with a punishing hand, no, it's about heaven in your heart.""

Of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin
And half my age
Hotter than the wax
On a saxifrage
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To turn my page
Steady your sails
For the butterfly flap
Whatever you do
Don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman
But she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim
Whatcha want
Whatcha need
Do you love
Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came
Now I know why we came
Now I know

Goodbye Angels;The Getaway;2016;;"Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my girl
In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time
Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light
Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the courtyard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, big fight
Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young
Say goodbye, my love, I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love, thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, this life
Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, find you
Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo, wonder
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, story
Say goodbye, my love, I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love, thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Babe, I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring
Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my bat
Suicide is never gonna save you
When I cried, it was because I came to
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, kiss this

Sick Love;The Getaway;2016;;"Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy life for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Superheroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail, my baby, it'll be your last
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Feasting On The Flowers;The Getaway;2016;;"I was walking through the streets I could not hear my best friend call
He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
The next dimension, show me in
We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, ""Oh, don't look back, just look ahead""
You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, ""Oh, don't look back, just look ahead""
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme

This Ticonderoga;The Getaway;2016;;"I met a man in a rock and roll band he said won't you come with me
I let him know that I could not go you see I get mine for free
We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite
Step inside the emotional ride I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary I call my best friend Flea
This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown between us there are lines
Yes I told her that
I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day
I would not have it any other way, well
Means so much to me
Can you see the we
What are we ever gonna do when all I want to be is next to you
I took a girl from the underworld and I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done she was not up for the fight
We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind
It's my favorite
So I savor it
I must report that life is short
So of your love I'll take ten quarts well
There's no end to this
Don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and
Am I crazy to
Join the lazy zoo
All these human butterflies and
Cactus flowers swollen eyes and
I want the devil's share
Of you I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do
When all these animals want to be just like you
I met a girl with long black hair and she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil and I picked her for my bride
We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right

Encore;The Getaway;2016;;"Listen to The Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon
We got high
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space
Too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut
Soviet Spy
Every now and then when I remember to befriend
The little things in life
Hey, you're fine I wanna listen to the radio driving down
Calexico highway and now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand, I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now
Later on, I'll read to you the things that I've been needing
To say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had
Tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off
'Fore you die
Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is
So much sky
Hey, you're fine, I wanna listen to the radio driving down Calexico
Highway and now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand, I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now
Skinny brains and little stains upon your
Face teenage remains tell me more
Lifted in the Fifties when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

Highway and now I know the signs, for sure, for sure
Hold my hand, I want to share it all with Mary

The Hunter;The Getaway;2016;;"Woke up this morning like I always do
Still, like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay
Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea
I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay
Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea
The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

Dreams Of A Samurai;The Getaway;2016;;"Standing naked in your kitchen
Feeling free that I could be alive
Clearly I'm a contradiction
Too young to be my wife
A peaceful storm is never hectic
Her mellow voice that I could be within
The uniform is anorexic
A jealous choice won't win
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai
Paint your face 'cause I'm a black foot
I thought I counted up the fireflies
Close enough to get a good look
Time to mobilize
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies
The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown
Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane

Black Summer;Unlimited Love;2022;;"A lazy rain am I
The skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon
A sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(Hit me now)
Platypus are a few
The secret life of roo
A personality I never knew
(Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton
The archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waiting on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waiting on another black summer to end
Crack the flaming whip
A-sailing on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waiting on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waiting on another black summer to end

Waiting on another black summer to end

Banged a mom 'cause I see no future
Sat her down when I poured that tea
I don't know 'cause I got big temper
Stick close to my rainbow side
Candy corn and that dancing leopard
That's all folks, that's all
She's the kinda girl who make you want to go faster now
She's the kinda girl who make you steal your child
She's the kind of girl, she's in the here ever after now
There's a cry for help and I don't deny
I don't know, but it's finally just one more mile
Peaches are sold and all giving up on that Humpty style
At the Caldwell, cross from black top
She's Eurasian met her at the Quick Stop
We danced at Tito's Go Go
Girlfriend's back now, she's gone solo
She's the kinda girl who make you want to go faster now

Wet my beak and I give it up to that drugstore nose
So unique and I live it up till that liquor store close
In the laundry queen ballistic
Mangy face with the messed up lipstick
My thing is blacked out loco
Smoke and tears, now take my photo

There's a cry for help and I don't deny

Bangin' hard with those daddy issues
Hanging out with that Chevron dude
Knocked her out so I let her kiss you
Redneck fights, I Hercules bit you
Big box, hoppin' on detox
Fast food trash when you're livin' in the crosswalk
Catch me out like motel hoes do
Blood on fries, now that's my go-to
She's the kinda girl who make you want to go faster now
She's the kinda girl who make you steal your child

Aquatic Mouth Dance;Unlimited Love;2022;;"Looking back at the years gone by
When The Message changed my life
Heavy metal the nest was dead
Well and the rappers gave delight
But I don't know who
Was looking out for anyone like me and you
Maybe it was Siouxsie Sioux
Day to day was the way we play
Well everybody needs to eat
Girl is gone and the front door too
Well I guess we move our feet and I don't know why
The color of your eyes was stolen from the sky
And earthquakes never need to lie
Aquatic mouth dance
Is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance
Is waiting for you now
Aquatic mouth dance
Is waiting for you
Everyone and their best friend knew
That the west was overdue
Growing out of the fertile dirt
Well and the cracks were falling through
But I don't know what
I'm looking for, I only know the deepest cut
It's coming from my gut
Parking lot of the old Starwood
Where the Misfits like to go
Billy Zoom and his silver string
Well it just might be John Doe and I don't know where
I'm gonna sleep tonight, please tell me can you spare
A pillow for my head and hair
Aquatic mouth dance
Is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance
Is waiting for you now

Pucker up for the hologram
I better find out who I am
Let it out with a downtown Scream
Because we need more space to jam
But I don't know how
To turn it down
I end up being so damn loud
Ah bend your brow, bend it now
Prototropical Sunday nights
Smog flowers they don't bite
Dirty skies never work so hard
Better step to the Angels Flight
And I don't know if
The embers of my burning flame are from this spliff
The greatest gift, the greatest gift
Peppered up at the Cathay bash with a 45 to split
Spilling beer is a good fountain
Like the milk from a mother's tit
But I don't know slow
Someone has to come and teach me self-control
Or should I just say fuck it and we go?

You think that I'm someone to choose
You see me in a way that makes me want to reinvent
A person I could turn into
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run
Blue strides are calling and I can't stop falling
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run

Long days of time have been unkind

When we grow old
Snakes get high
Or so I'm told
She's a lynch mob
On the street
Take another step
And I will kill the beat

Come on now you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy

When did life get so damn cautious
So I drive in search of smiles

Anyway, I was headed South
Taste of coffee in my mouth
Up that off ramp 405
Angry drivers on both sides
Got a call from my good friend Dave
He said, ""Yo, let's get that wave""
I said, ""Yes, just tell me where""
Board's up top, wind in my hair
From the mind of Frida Kahlo
Show me love and I will follow
From the words of my old man
Conversations in the sand

To spread my bread onto
Time and time again
We get a window and a clue
Time and time again
Life changing rendezvous
Anyway, made a left on 3rd
Got distracted jumped that curb
Unaware and on her walk
I hit the brakes made time to talk
She said, ""Can I get that ride?""
Oh my God, just get inside
It was all that I imagined
Born to ride, enthusiasm
Packed our bags
And headed west
PCH
I'm so impressed
My friends said
""Having fun yet?""
We drove off
Into the sunset

Stripped and clean
A restless wolverine
An eloquent part of the whole dance

Tell the whole world to slow down
We gotta get off and we gotta go 'round
Tell the whole world to roll down
The window is broken, forever unspoken
Only whenever
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
Chemistry
Death to rise
Subtraction of advice
The criminal ties of my rival
And I'll roll these dice
Cold supply
Scraping to get by
Blatantly flooding the low rise
And I'll throw this knife
Trace me now through your innocence
Tell me it's part of the program I started
Space me now through your citizens
Tell me it's part of the whole plan now
Breaking my slow hand

No stranger the shadow of somebody else

But the form of life is long never-ending
And the smell of your hello I know
And the smile of a knife is seldom befriending
And the smell of tangelo I know
When I'm near you, I feel like a king
A life force inside to do anything
When I'm downtown, I pick up the phone
I hear you, and I'm not alone
But the form of life is long never ending
And the smell of your hello I know
And the smile of a knife is seldom befriending
And the smell of tangelo I know
But December came strong, the mending went wrong
And the clothes on the line never dried
And the crows on my hill came in for the kill
But the dream of this love never died
When I lost you out in that field
My crooked eyes could hardly conceal
Tell me one time and bring me my tray
Oh, let it go, and now I must pray
Let's pray

This dancing's so alive
The onion never stays peeled
Everybody move, everybody glide
Stab me with colored pencils
Backseat and butterflies
A song for flesh utensils

The court of social flaws
Some other dude she dated

Break this fall, the excellence has it's
Own say, own say

With the greasy hair
Hard as nails but soft to wear
Rooftop crops up
And a folding chair
Pay your thug store Hench
Mugshot daddy
With the golden wrench
Locomotive smoke to cover up what's broke
Please don't seize me
Until you get my joke

Get it on the line

To Northern Jordie
I'll tell you when I move
To hell and then I'll prove
The violin said, oh, woah, woah
And now the moment
The one we notice
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Weeping on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold her
Bella cries and that's alright, she's
Leaking on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold Bella
Leaking on my shoulder again, that Bella
Baby girl is on my team now, Bella
Weeping on my shoulder again, well, Bella

Roulette;Return Of The Dream Canteen;2022;;"The college years were lean, well
Coming out but maybe not so clean, my love
And if I stay much longer
My feelings for you, they might get much stronger now
A Motorola coma
Sleep your way into a deep diploma, girl
At the dormitory
You come to pour me one of your best stories, girl
And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side
And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like the Massachusetts threat
Running wild
A pair of dirty jeans, well
You would wash inside my brass machine, that's good
Laying on your mattress
A thing of beauty, we would need more practice now
Hall and Oates were singing
The funny notes that you were always bringing, girl
An elevator's closing
Hard to hide when love is so exposing
And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side
And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like the Massachusetts threat
Running wild
When I drove her
To Villanova
Light me up when you decide
The stark aroma
Of your Tacoma
A tiny box where we reside
Battle tested
A life invested
Duly noted and denied
Fully loaded
Space encoded
A quiet night out in the sky
Your stack of lies was daunting
A tribute to your mind, but way more haunting now
A talking psycho killer
Betrayed the heads of even Henry Miller now
Conspiracy's a theory
I wonder, Tim, if this could be your Leary, love
She acts like Marlon Brando
Born online inside the San Fernando

Just one possession in the life that we get
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Jumping Jiminy the cat is in the chimney
Curtain call and I need some anonymity
Trip my balls beat
Lost on Wall Street
We all fall
That's my cross street
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
This business of forgiveness
Free your mind and we bare witness
Bring me windshield wiper fluid
Clean my slate so I'm not clueless
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Charming mister deadpan laughter
Walking towards the things we're after
Dancing David Lee toastmaster
Take some chances that's my rapper

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
So many daydreams that I tend to forget
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Jumping Jiminy the cat is in the chimney
A curtain call and I need some anonymity
Smokey defect
Time to reflect
My game
And now we eject

And if I'm feelin' uptight, gonna leave it alone
We're gonna board up on the flight to the great unknown, well
That's all I'm saying now
Hear what I'm playing, yes
High on a light from above
You're somebody special, well
Someone to wrestle now

Well, on a cold, cold night round a Baton Rouge
We gonna make it alright with Iggy the Stooge, well
Pull on my lever, it's
My guilty pleasure, yes
Born to live life on the run
Take from this river, and
Give to the ocean, yeah
They gave us more than enough

Shoot Me A Smile;Return Of The Dream Canteen;2022;;"Swimming around
There's something new to be found
It's such a beautiful sound
Bare naked feet on the ground
Swimming around
And I will sing you a song always
A nautical mile
You be the sun to my dial
I'll be the rank in your file
Just come with me for a while
A nautical mile
And I will shoot you the breeze always
Flowers in bloom
I get 'em off of the moon
To make my baby go boom
I put my grease in your spoon
Flowers in bloom
And you're the colors of June
Some days
Here we come
We're not far away
And I'll tell you more
When I come to stay
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
Here we come
And we're very close
And I'll give you more
With this micro dose
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
Out on the road
I've got some cases to load
Some other places to go
Some other faces to know
Out on the road
Where I will show you the love parade
A lateral move
With nothing better to prove
Just hanging out with the crew
I'll put the wop in your doo
A lateral move
With nothing better to prove some days
Give me a home
I cannot make it alone
I need to share what I own
I'll be the cream in your cone
Give me a home
And I will show you the love always
Here we come
We're not far away
And I'll tell you more
When I come to stay
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
Here we come
And we're very close
And I'll give you more
With this micro dose
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
I don't ever wanna lose my head
Last name's Hot and my first name's Red
I don't ever wanna get so tight
Wearing it loose like a summer's night
Strappin' for cash
I'm eating bangers and mash
And I remember The Clash
And I remember The Clash
Strappin 'for cash
But I will make you feel safe always
Bring it around
Just like the fox and the hound
Because it's openly crowned
I'm on a merry-go-round
Bring it around
And I will sleep with a smile always
I never began
Because I'm never to end
I'm gonna buck every trend
I'm gonna make you my friend
I never began
But I will give you a start always
Here we come
We're not far away
And I'll tell you more
When I come to stay
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
Here we come
And we're very close
And I'll give you more

Shoot me a smile

I'll stick and move, you know I don't feel no disgrace
I'll take it all off so everyone can see
The damage that I am, all the troubles that I be
Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older, yeah
There's a chapter in my book that I don't want you read
There's a chapter in my life where I failed to succeed
I wanna take your smell inside my dirty mind
You put a spell on me, no, I'm not the dying kind
Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older
Someone to love for the rest of your days
Out on the road
Sky turns to water and night into days
Someone to hold
I need to see you comin' 'round my front door
It don't matter why, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
It don't matter what for
Let's turn your body into a drive-in movie screen
You can shoot 'em all down so they won't steal my dream
Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older
Someone to love for the rest of your days
Out on the road
Sky turns to water and night into days
Someone to hold
I wanna splash a little love on your face
You fill me right up while you put me in my place
God only knows what she's got up her sleeve
And God only goes to the places that we need
Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older
Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time

The Drummer;Return Of The Dream Canteen;2022;;"Stay awake
Fall asleep
Take a look at what you think and what you
Really need to keep
My atoms are indivisible
Shut it up
Run it down
Live a life that's underground
A heated love
That's not allowed
A Dum Dum Club is inadmissible
Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore
Walk it back
Get the knack
Information to unpack a guitar in a gunny sack
My best move is in the criminal
Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore
Let's move like the Chapatula do
I'd be down to wallow in New Orleans
See-through sunrise on the Waterloo
Slits are rather fancy when they're forming
I do
Better days
On the way
Flowing like a manta ray the Dodgers made a double play
My dance moves are sub subliminal
Let's make a wish as we enter the lift
'Cause the system's a relative bore
The drummer is leaning without any meaning
Outside of the Club Troubadour
I don't know you and I don't know what's true anymore
Listen to my one request
I don't know you
And I don't know what's true anymore

Bag Of Grins;Return Of The Dream Canteen;2022;;"In my day I could hear them say
Mr. K was awfully close
Now we take that bow you know
'Cause it's time to meet your ghost
And I don't understand
Minotaurs and jaguars
Are at my finger's tip
Falling up through the mustard gates
And I think I broke my hip
And I don't understand
I do not understand
9:00 I turn my heels and sigh
For one last time
10:30 I tied my chi
And died up on the vine
Send me out to the pasture, love
With a closet full of whips
The coroner spins with his bag of grins
As he's sewing up my lips
And I don't understand
9:00 I turn my heels and sigh
For one last time
10:30 I tied my chi
And died up on the vine
I died up on the vine
Suddenly when the moment comes
And it's harmony or rage
Flowers cry on the corpse of love
And it's time to turn your page
Mr. and Mrs. Au Contraire
I think they'll soon arrive
All the treasures you have saved
Your children now divide
And I don't understand
I do not understand
9:00 I turn my heels and-
Suddenly when the moment comes
And it's harmony or rage
Flowers cry on the corpse of love
And it's time to turn your page
I am somewhere else my love
And I think you'll know just where to find me
Out in an interstellar place and there's
Nothing left here to define me
You are somewhere else good love
And this life of crime that's all behind me
We are all just space and love
And I think you'll know that's who designed me
I am somewhere else my love
And I think you'll know just where to find me
Out in an interstellar place and there's
Nothing left here to define me
You are somewhere else good love
And this life of crime that's all behind me
We are all just space and love
And I think you'll know that's who designed

We could start a family feud
Laugh so hard they'll think we're rude
I'll fuck up and get so mad
Act just like my broken dad
Chris Columbus solitaire
Whistle when you want me there
Give me your honey
I won't spend it in one place
Bended knee to get a taste
I wanna spin my wheels with you
Win and lose some deals with you
Tell me how it feels for you
To order happy meals for two
And when it all seems out of reach
We'll clean up plastic off the beach
Your figure is a perfect speech
You'll be Chong and I'll be Cheech
Give me your honey

It doesn't matter where we move
I lost you at the Vegas Louvre
But we don't need no rings to prove
Crippled by some looping fears
The ripples of a lost career
Phone call from a financier
And no one lives like Norman Lear
Give me your honey
I won't spend it in one place
Bended knee to get a taste

Dancing on the cold roof while your lemon tree cries

Never make another bed where you're enemy lies
Tread not
Away from your heart
Sweat not
Right from the start
Copperbelly hiding out there in every mirror
Copperbelly try to fill you with meaningless fear
Someone's in love with emotional pain
Keys to this kingdom that come with your name
I don't wanna go, she don't wanna know
They don't want to so, so, so, so
Easy to need when it all reads the same
Copperbelly wanna tell you there's nobody out there
Take it on the chin as you look for the win
Copperbelly wanna tell you that you better not dare
Copperbelly wanna sell you a tub full of gin
We all
Suffer our losses
We all
Know the bad breaks
Sleeping on the sled of this old western decline
Living in your head, taking way too much time
Someone's in love with emotional pain
Keys to this kingdom that come with your name
I don't wanna go, she don't wanna know
They don't want to so, so, so, so
Easy to need when it all reads the same
Clockwork is Orange and built for Compression
Stumbling upstairs, am I somebody who?
Start work is free and so full of impressions
Abstraction face and I look just like you
Take me by my warm hand and I'll be there
I'll be in your evening chair

You wanted me to know the ups and downs
Away we go to get another hit, the it
The blood that she's about to spit
You go your way and I guess I'll go mine
We'll both arrive at the very same time
Please give me your tired, give me your poor
Please lift up your lamp, walk through this door
Kick down the doors that you don't understand
Please don't lose sight of this generous plan
Blinded by prisms, we wind up in court
I'm folding chairs while you sold yourself short
She's about to redefine the way
Reminded me to say the other way was right
She's in a place to pray for me
And now we've got to flash the funky light
You've got your way and it seems I've got mine
Both gonna die at the very same time

And I'll take my time
And I'll move it forward now
Do you want to come with me?

Spotlights born to shine at night
Come what may, it always might
Burn so bright

Slow rodeo in the snow
Slow rodeo
Hold over, roll over
Slow rodeo in the snow
High-waisted, she tasted like a salacious confrontation salvation
From the salivating demarcation of Columbian incarnation of the patron saint of palliation
Her milk framed and rose satin, untamed by the silk
That framed her Manhattan trap door which became duly unbattened
She's Latin, out cattin'
Does everything that feels so nice
Come with an inverted price
I still don't know
The ball is clearly in my court
And I am happy to report
It's moving slow
Tell me what you want to see
Tell me what you want
And I'll take my time

Roll over, roll over
Slow rodeo in the snow
Slow rodeo
Hold over, roll over
Of a humbling Colombian
Two socks and a tumble in her slumber skin
The summer wind, we crumble some
The rock and rumble of a tumbling bubblegum
Some other umbrella trellis forgot to tell us that the mellow tangelo is jealous
For the various and not necessarily contrary shell show
She said, ""Hell no""
The cock bottom temple varies like autumn lights soft the cost
The Fibonacci lost her sauce
Into the last remaining hostage boss, sweet toss
Now I lay me down to reap the sleep of your selective sedative
Repetitive
An uncredited she comes well-vetted
Gracefully and studied
Blue steadiness
The wrath, the math
The not yet fractured tabernacle of the Basil Rathbone
And the last disaster casting
Impassible laughter blocks my path
Blue chaff
Blue chaff
Blue chaff
